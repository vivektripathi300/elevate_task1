What is an Attack Surface?

An attack surface is the sum of all possible entry points where an attacker can try to access, exploit, or compromise a system, application, or network.

Rule: More exposed components = larger attack surface = higher risk.

1. Web Applications 🌐

Web applications are one of the largest and most targeted attack surfaces.

Common Vulnerabilities:

SQL Injection

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Authentication & session flaws

File upload vulnerabilities

Real-World Examples:

Online banking portals

E-commerce websites

Social media platforms

Typical Attacks:

Stealing user credentials

Database dumps

Website defacement

Security Controls:

Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Input validation

Secure authentication (MFA)

Regular vulnerability scanning

📌 OWASP Top 10 mainly focuses on web app risks.

2. Mobile Applications 📱

Mobile apps interact with backend servers and APIs, creating multiple attack points.

Common Vulnerabilities:

Insecure local storage

Hardcoded credentials

Weak encryption

Insecure communication (HTTP instead of HTTPS)

Reverse engineering

Real-World Examples:

Banking apps

Payment apps (UPI, wallets)

Social media apps

Typical Attacks:

App tampering

Credential extraction

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks

Security Controls:

Certificate pinning

Secure storage (Keychain, Keystore)

Code obfuscation

Runtime protection

📌 Mobile attacks often exploit poor backend security.


  3. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) 🔗

APIs connect applications, mobile apps, and cloud services—making them high-value targets.

Common Vulnerabilities:

Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)

Excessive data exposure

Lack of rate limiting

Improper authentication

Insecure API endpoints

Real-World Examples:

Payment APIs

Login APIs

Third-party integrations

Typical Attacks:

Account takeover

Data scraping

API abuse

Security Controls:

OAuth 2.0 / JWT

Rate limiting & throttling

API gateways

Logging & monitoring

📌 OWASP API Top 10 covers these risks.

4. Network Infrastructure 🌐

Networks form the foundation of enterprise IT and cloud environments.

Common Vulnerabilities:

Open ports & services

Weak firewall rules

Unpatched devices

Misconfigured routers/switches

Weak VPN configurations

Real-World Examples:

Corporate LAN/WAN

Data centers

ISP infrastructure

Typical Attacks:

Network scanning & enumeration

Brute-force attacks

Man-in-the-Middle

Lateral movement

Security Controls:

Firewalls & IDS/IPS

Network segmentation

Zero Trust model

Continuous monitoring (SIEM)

📌 Most breaches start with network reconnaissance.

5. Cloud Infrastructure ☁️

Cloud environments introduce shared responsibility and configuration risks.

Common Vulnerabilities:

Misconfigured storage (public S3 buckets)

Weak IAM policies

Exposed management interfaces

Insecure container images

Poor logging

Real-World Examples:

AWS, Azure, GCP

Cloud-hosted databases

Kubernetes clusters

Typical Attacks:

Credential abuse

Data exfiltration

Cloud resource hijacking

Privilege escalation

Security Controls:

IAM least privilege

Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)

Encryption at rest & in transit

Cloud-native logging

📌 Most cloud breaches happen due to misconfiguration, not cloud provider failure.
