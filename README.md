What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, applications, and data from digital attacks such as hacking, malware, data breaches, and unauthorized access. Its main goal is to ensure that information stays safe, accurate, and accessible to authorized users.

A core foundation of cybersecurity is the CIA Triad:

1. Confidentiality 🔒

Confidentiality means ensuring that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized people.

How it is achieved:

*Authentication (username & password, biometrics)

*Authorization (role-based access)

*Encryption

*Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

*Real-world examples:

Banking

Your bank account details and PIN are encrypted.

Only you can access your account using credentials and OTP.

Employees can access data based on their role (teller, manager, auditor).

Social Media

Private messages on WhatsApp or Instagram are end-to-end encrypted.

Account privacy settings control who can see your posts.

Login alerts notify you of suspicious access.

📌 If confidentiality fails → data leakage or identity theft can occur.

2. Integrity 🛡️

Integrity ensures that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered unless modified by an authorized user.

How it is achieved:

*Hashing (SHA-256, MD5)

*Digital signatures

*Checksums

*Access control & logging

Real-world examples:

Banking

Transaction amounts cannot be changed during transfer.

If someone tries to alter a transaction, the system detects it.

Logs track every change for auditing.

Social Media

Posts and comments remain unchanged unless edited by the user.

Verified accounts help prevent impersonation.

Digital signatures ensure updates come from trusted sources.

📌 If integrity fails → fraud, misinformation, or incorrect data may appear.

3. Availability ⚙️

Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed by authorized users.

How it is achieved:

*Redundant servers

*Load balancing

*Regular backups

Protection against DDoS attacks

Real-world examples:

Banking

Online banking services are available 24/7.

Backup servers ensure services continue even during failures.

ATM networks stay operational even if one server fails.

Social Media

Platforms like Facebook and Twitter remain online despite high traffic.

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) help reduce downtime.

Anti-DDoS systems prevent service outages.
